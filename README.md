Baby Tolk is a "do the right thing" tool for transpiling. It reads a file from the file system, transpiles it (including sourcemaps where supported) with the available transpilers. This is based on the [Tolk](https://github.com/Munter/tolk) but does less things based on the "small modules that do one thing" philosophy.

Returns a promise that resolves with the resulting transpiler output.

Installing the individual transpilers baby tolk should use is up to the consumer. There are no transpiler dependencies out of the box. So if you only need babel and sass, install `babel` and `node-sass`.

Tolk is useful for tools that handle precompiling for you, but might also be used directly in your task runner of preference in order to skip some of the many plugins that do the same but worse.

**Current precompiler support:** `LiveScript`, `babel`, `coco`, `coffee-script`, `dogescript`, `less`, `marked`, `myth`, `node-sass`, `stylus`, `swig`


Usage
-----

```
npm install baby-tolk
```

Out of the box this won't transpile anything. In order to do more, for example babel and sass, also do this:

```
npm install node-sass babel
```

Now you are ready to start reading files from the file system. Tolk automatically loads the transpilers it has access to in the scope it is run in.

```js
var tolk = require('tolk');

tolk.read('path/to/stylesheet.scss').done(function (compiled) {
  // compiled.result is the transpiled output as a string
  console.log(compiled.result);

  // compiled.sourcemap is the transpiled output as an object
  // You can use JSON.stringify to convert it to a string
  console.log(JSON.stringify(compiled.sourcemap));
}, function (err) {
  // In case anything failed
  throw err;
});
```
